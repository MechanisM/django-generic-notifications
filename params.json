{"name":"Django-generic-notifications","body":"========\r\nOverview\r\n========\r\n\r\n**A Django app that can handle multiple ways of showing different notification types. It's all based on multiple input types and output backends.**\r\n\r\n\r\nNotifications\r\n=============\r\nA notification could be anything:\r\n\r\n- you have received a private message on a forum\r\n- there is a new comment on your blog\r\n- someone liked your profile or article\r\n- a new post was created in a thread you follow\r\n- someone answered your poll\r\n- you have a new friend request or follower\r\n\r\nAs far as this project is concerned, a notification is nothing more but an (optional) subject, text body, and a list of receivers.\r\n\r\nBackends\r\n========\r\nThere are multiple output backends. Some possible examples are:\r\n\r\n- email\r\n- sms message\r\n- iPhone push notification\r\n- notification center\r\n\r\nAt this moment only two email backends are provided.\r\n\r\nNotification types\r\n==================\r\nA notification type is the glue between a message (input) and one or more possible backends (output). For example, you might want to send all account related messages to email only, but notifications about new private messages could go to email, iPhone push messages, Django's own messages app, you name it.\r\n\r\nEach notification type can specify its allowed backend(s), and each user can specify his preferred output backend(s). Each notification will then figure out what backend to use based on this information.\r\n\r\nSettings\r\n========\r\nSome backends will need extra information from the user, for example a phone number or email address.\r\n\r\nUsers can also select which notification types they're interested in, and what possible backends they would like to receive the message on.\r\n\r\nQueue\r\n=====\r\nMost notification backends can't process in real time, instead adding them to a queue. At this moment, this is based on a simple database model and a manage.py script which can be used from your cron.\r\n\r\nIn the future celery tasks should be added too.","tagline":"Generic notification system for Django, with multiple input types and output backends","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
